Initialize the stack (i.e., items[]) with the let keyword, as let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used. Use proper methods for push and pop operations of the stack. Print the stack for each time when you call push() and pop() so that the elements present in the stack will display.Â
