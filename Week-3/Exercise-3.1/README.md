Exercise 3.1:

Create a memoize function that remembers previous inputs and stores them in cache so that itwonâ€™t have to compute the same inputs more than once. The function will take an unspecifiednumber of integer inputs and a reducer method. (1.5hours)

Guidelines:

1.The memozie function should be written from scratch.

2.3rd party libraries such as loaddash or underscore should not have been used.

3.The function should carry a name which should denote the functionality of it.

4.The function should be able to take n number of arguments.
