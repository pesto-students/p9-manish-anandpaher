<h2>Guidelines: </h2>

1.The expected output should be achieved using Iterators only.

2.Reference:https://medium.com/@akshayshekokar/fibonacci-series-with-iterators-90a8b3dd0d92 

3.For Loops, Maps should not have been used.

4.3rd party libraries should not have been used.

<h2>Outcome: </h2>

1.Understanding how Iterators work.

2.Understanding ‘under the hood’ implementation of Iterators.
