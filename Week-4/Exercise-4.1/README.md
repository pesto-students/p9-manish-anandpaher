<h2>Exercise4.1: </h2>

Implement a function namedgetNumberwhich generatesa random number. If randomNumberis divisible by 5 it will reject the promise else it will resolve the promise. Let’s also keep thepromise resolution/rejection time as a variable.

1.JS promises should not be used.

2.A custom promise function should be created.

3.This function should be able to handle all 3 states Resolve, Reject and Fulfilled.

4.Should be able to accept callbacks as props.

<h2>Guidelines: </h2>

1.JS promises should not be used.

2.3rd party libraries should not be used.

3.Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.

4.The program should execute without errors.

5.The program should achieve the desired result.

6.The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.

7.Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages.

<h2>Outcome: </h2>

1.Under the hood understanding of how a promise actually works.

2.Using “bind” to bind the callback functions sent as props.

3.Understanding what a polyfill is.

4.Error handling using functions.

<h2>Output: </h2>
