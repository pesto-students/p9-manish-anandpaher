<h2>Exercise5.1:</h2>

Using Async/Await and Generators, create separate functions and achieve the samefunctionality.(3hours)

Execute 3 callback functions asynchronously, for example doTask1(), doTask2() and doTask3().

<h2>Guidelines:</h2>

1.2 functions should be created. One for Async/Await and the other one for Generators.

2.3rd party libraries should not be used.

3.Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.

4.The program should execute without errors.

5.The program should achieve the desired result.

6.The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.

7.Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages.

<h2>Outcome:</h2>

1.Under the hood understanding of how a Generator works.

2.Under the hood understanding of how Async/await works.
