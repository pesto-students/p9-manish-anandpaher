<h2>Problem 7.6 : 3 sum</h2>

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to agiven number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. Assume that there will only beone solution

Example: given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1. The sum that is closest to thetarget is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
