<h2>Problem 7.3: Sort array of 0's,1's and 2's</h2>

Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascendingorder. 

Example 1:

Input:

N = 5

arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}

Output:

0 0 1 2 2

Explanation: 0's 1's and 2's are segregated into ascending order.

Example 2:

Input:

N = 3

arr[] = {0 1 0}

Output:

0 0 1

Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order. 

Time Complexity: O(N)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints: 1 <= N <= 10^6 0 <= A[i] <= 2

<h2>Solution:</h2>
