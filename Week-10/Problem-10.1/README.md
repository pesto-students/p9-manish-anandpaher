<h2>Problem 10.1: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree</h2>

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
  
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from theroot node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
  
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
  
Output: 3
  
Example 2:
  
Input: root = [1,null,2]
  
Output: 2
  
Constraints:
  
●The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
  
●100 <= Node.val <= 100
